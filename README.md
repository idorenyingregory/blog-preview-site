# What I Learned
This exercise helped me understand the various ways that items can be positioned using CSS and how responsiveness can be achieved in a code for users with different screen sizes to access my website without experiencing UI/UX incompatibilities. The use of `(display: flex)` and `(media @ (max-width: 774;)`.
